done.

After doing for real, run svn status:
  ! entries from svn status should be svn removed, and
  ? entries should be svn added.
make svnstatus at the top level makes three temp files for this job;
  see comments there.
Do not do svn update before committing, or the rm's just done will be lost.

Sadly, the sync script does not remove directories, only all the files
inside.  Please fix.  Need to remove by hand until fixed.

After svn looks good, do make build (more needed updates may be discovered).
make versionhelp will run --version and --help on the resulting binary.

When the build looks good, commit.

When the commit succeeds, do svn update afterward, due to removals.

Good luck.
